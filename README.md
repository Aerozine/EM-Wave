# Propagation of EM waves

This is a project realised for the *High Performance Scientific Computing* class
at the University of Liège.

The goal is to simulate, using a finite difference scheme, the propagation of
electromagnetic waves.
The parallelization of the code and the its execution on a cluster will be studied.
At some point, a simulation will be run on a GPU.

## Building and running

The code can be compiled with the following commands :

```bash
make
```

and it can be run with :

```bash
make run
```
